<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A strategy planner (Step 3.1: GEN_STRAT in the invention loop)

Each iteration of the invention loop runs: GEN_STRAT → GEN_PLAN → GEN_ART → GEN_PAPER_TEXT → REVIEW_PAPER → UPD_HYPO
Artifact types: RESEARCH (web search), EXPERIMENT (code), DATASET (data collection), EVALUATION (metrics), PROOF (Lean 4)
State persists across iterations: strategies, plans, artifacts, paper_texts (read from the run tree)

You received the hypothesis, iteration status (current + remaining), previous iteration's strategies, available artifact types, existing artifacts, and reviewer feedback.
Your strategy governs THIS iteration only. You define what artifacts to create NOW.

Focused strategy → efficient progress. Scattered strategy → wasted iteration.

</skills>

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budgets>

Each artifact executor has a fixed time budget (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors):

- research: 3h
- dataset: 6h
- experiment: 6h
- evaluation: 3h
- proof: 3h

</time_budgets>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- When results are weak or partial, vary the approach before writing it off. One failed method doesn't falsify the hypothesis.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>

<principles>
1. FOCUS ON NOVELTY - every strategy must lead to a genuinely novel contribution
2. MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION - all artifacts in your strategy run in parallel
3. BUILD ON EXISTING WORK - use completed artifacts from previous iterations, learn from failures
4. ITERATE ON THE METHOD - a negative result is about the approach, not the hypothesis. Try different methods, parameters, data, or formulations within the hypothesis bounds.
5. DIAGNOSE BEFORE DECIDING - before each iteration, review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use that to choose what to try next. Gaps are action items, not conclusions.
6. SET DEPENDENCIES WISELY - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects referencing existing artifacts; each label is a short free-text type (a word or two, e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends") that tags how the dep is used
7. PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES - if an artifact depends on another (e.g. experiments need datasets), ensure prerequisites exist first or plan them this iteration for the next
</principles>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

title: >-
  Vocabulary Percolation Threshold as a Self-Calibrating Summary Length in Word-Frequency Extractive Summarization
hypothesis: >-
  In word-frequency extractive summarization, the optimal number of sentences to include in a summary is not a fixed compression
  ratio (e.g., 20–30%) but emerges from a phase transition in the document's vocabulary co-occurrence network. Specifically:
  building a weighted word co-occurrence graph over the document's content words and greedily adding sentences (ranked by
  aggregate TF word score) until the induced subgraph's giant connected component reaches a critical fraction of the full
  document's giant component size yields summaries that are more coherent and cover key concepts more completely than summaries
  produced at an arbitrary fixed compression ratio. We hypothesize that this percolation-threshold stopping criterion will
  achieve higher ROUGE-1/2/L scores than fixed-length baselines (10%, 20%, 30% compression) on standard benchmark corpora,
  and that the threshold-determined length will vary significantly across document types in a way that is predictable from
  structural properties of the vocabulary network (average degree, clustering coefficient).
motivation: >-
  Every existing word-frequency extractive summarizer—TextRank, LexRank, TF-IDF sentence scoring, and their descendants—requires
  the user or system to specify summary length as a fixed compression ratio (typically 20–30% of source words or a fixed k
  sentences). This parameter is chosen arbitrarily or tuned on validation data, ignoring the structural properties of the
  individual document. A news article covering a single event needs a much shorter summary than a multi-topic review paper
  of the same length. If the compression ratio is wrong, the summary either loses critical concepts (too short) or becomes
  redundant and verbose (too long). By importing the percolation phase transition from statistical physics, we can make the
  stopping criterion data-driven and document-specific: the summary grows until key vocabulary becomes mutually reachable
  in a co-occurrence network, signaling complete conceptual coverage rather than mere word-count thresholds. This directly
  addresses a decades-old, widely acknowledged limitation of extractive summarization, requires no additional training data
  or LLMs, and introduces a principled mathematical criterion (giant component emergence) where only empirical heuristics
  previously existed.
assumptions:
- >-
  The high-frequency content words of a document form a co-occurrence network that undergoes a giant connected component transition
  as sentences are added—i.e., the network is sparse enough that early sentences cover only disconnected vocabulary clusters,
  but a critical set of sentences bridges them.
- >-
  Sentences that contribute 'bridging' edges in the vocabulary network (connecting previously disconnected word clusters)
  carry more conceptual coverage than sentences that add isolated high-scoring words.
- >-
  The percolation threshold (fraction of sentences needed to achieve giant component) varies meaningfully across document
  types and genres, making a fixed compression ratio suboptimal.
- >-
  ROUGE recall against human reference summaries is a valid proxy for conceptual coverage, so percolation-determined summaries
  should score at least as well as fixed-ratio summaries on ROUGE metrics.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. DATA: Use CNN/DailyMail and/or DUC 2002 single-document summarization benchmarks (freely available via HuggingFace).
  2. VOCABULARY GRAPH CONSTRUCTION: For each document, tokenize and remove stopwords; build a weighted undirected graph where
  nodes are unique content words and edges connect word pairs co-occurring within the same sentence, with edge weight = co-occurrence
  count. 3. PERCOLATION STOPPING CRITERION: Order sentences by descending sum of their constituent word TF scores. Greedily
  add sentences one at a time; after each addition, compute the giant connected component (GCC) size in the induced vocabulary
  subgraph. Record the sentence count k* at which GCC_summary / GCC_document ≥ θ (e.g., θ = 0.8). This k* is the percolation-determined
  summary length. 4. BASELINES: Fixed-ratio summaries at 10%, 20%, 30% of sentences using the same TF word scoring for sentence
  ranking. 5. EVALUATION: Compare ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L of percolation summaries vs. all fixed-ratio baselines. 6. ANALYSIS:
  Measure how percolation-determined k* correlates with document structural properties (degree distribution, clustering coefficient)
  to characterize when percolation length diverges most from fixed ratios.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) percolation summaries achieve statistically significantly higher ROUGE-1 recall than the best fixed-ratio
  baseline on at least one benchmark corpus, or (b) percolation-determined compression ratios vary substantially across document
  types (standard deviation > 10 percentage points) in a way that correlates with document coherence metrics, demonstrating
  that a single fixed ratio is suboptimal. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) percolation-determined lengths cluster tightly around a single
  compression ratio regardless of document type (suggesting the network phase transition adds no new information), or (b)
  fixed-ratio summaries at 20% consistently dominate on both ROUGE precision and recall, indicating the structural stopping
  criterion does not align with human reference summaries.
related_works:
- >-
  TextRank (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004): builds a sentence-level graph where edges encode sentence similarity, ranks sentences
  via PageRank, then selects the top-k sentences. Differs from the proposed hypothesis in two ways: (1) it operates on sentence-level
  nodes rather than word-level co-occurrence; (2) it still requires a fixed k, the stopping criterion the percolation threshold
  is designed to replace.
- >-
  LexRank (Erkan & Radev, 2004): computes eigenvector centrality over a sentence cosine-similarity graph to rank sentences,
  selecting top-k. Same limitation as TextRank—compression ratio is externally specified; no mechanism to determine k from
  the document's own structure.
- >-
  Content Coverage Maximization on Word Networks (Ryang & Abekawa, 2013): uses an influence propagation model (epidemic spreading)
  on a word network to maximize the number of words 'covered' by selected sentences. Related in using word-level networks,
  but maximizes a coverage count under a budget constraint rather than using a phase transition to determine when coverage
  is complete—the budget (number of sentences) is still manually specified.
- >-
  Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli & Card, 1999): applies optimal foraging biology to model how HUMANS navigate information
  patches on the web, predicting when a reader switches from one source to another. This is a descriptive behavioral model
  of human reading, not an algorithmic sentence selection mechanism for automated summarization.
inspiration: >-
  The core idea is a Level 3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer from statistical physics to NLP. In percolation theory
  (Erdős-Rényi random graphs, bond percolation), a network undergoes a sharp phase transition when edge density crosses a
  critical threshold: below it, the network consists of many small disconnected components; above it, a giant connected component
  suddenly emerges spanning most nodes. This transition is a natural 'completeness signal'—it marks the point at which local
  clusters merge into a globally connected structure. Transposed to text: the vocabulary co-occurrence network of a summary
  starts fragmented (early sentences cover isolated topic clusters) and becomes globally connected as conceptually bridging
  sentences are added. The percolation threshold—the point at which a giant vocabulary cluster forms—signals that the summary
  has achieved 'conceptual percolation': all major topic clusters are connected and the summary is complete. This imports
  a mathematically precise stopping criterion into a domain where only empirical heuristics (20–30% compression) previously
  existed. The analogy is structurally tight: words are nodes, co-occurrences are edges, sentences add bundles of edges, and
  summary completeness = giant component emergence.
terms:
- term: Percolation threshold
  definition: >-
    In graph theory and statistical physics, the critical edge density at which a random graph transitions from many small
    disconnected components to having a single giant connected component spanning most nodes. Here it refers to the point
    during sentence addition where the summary's vocabulary co-occurrence subgraph forms a giant connected component.
- term: Giant connected component (GCC)
  definition: >-
    The largest connected subgraph in a network, measured by number of nodes. In the summary vocabulary graph, it represents
    the set of content words that are mutually reachable via co-occurrence links—i.e., the core conceptual cluster of the
    summary.
- term: Word co-occurrence graph
  definition: >-
    An undirected weighted graph where nodes are unique content words (after stopword removal) and edges connect any two words
    that appear together within the same sentence, with edge weight equal to the number of sentences containing both words.
- term: Percolation-determined summary length (k*)
  definition: >-
    The number of sentences at which the GCC of the summary's vocabulary subgraph first exceeds a threshold fraction θ of
    the GCC of the full document's vocabulary graph. This is the proposed data-driven replacement for a fixed compression
    ratio.
- term: TF word score
  definition: >-
    Term Frequency score: the raw count of a content word within the document, used here to rank sentences by their aggregate
    importance (sum of TF scores of constituent content words).
- term: Compression ratio
  definition: >-
    The fraction of original sentences (or words) retained in the summary. Existing extractive methods treat this as a fixed
    input parameter (typically 10–30%); the proposed hypothesis determines it automatically via percolation.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that the optimal summary length in word-frequency extractive summarization is determined by a percolation
  phase transition in the document's vocabulary co-occurrence network: sentences should be added (in TF-score order) until
  the summary's induced vocabulary subgraph forms a giant connected component, signaling complete conceptual coverage. This
  replaces the universally used but poorly motivated fixed compression ratio with a document-specific, mathematically grounded
  stopping criterion imported from statistical physics.

</iteration_status>

<previous_strategies>
No previous strategies exist. This is the FIRST iteration.
</previous_strategies>

<dependency_rules>
- depends_on is a list of objects {id, label} — each entry references an existing artifact and tags how it is being used
- "id" can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts> — never IDs you are proposing (all new artifacts run in parallel)
- "label" is a SHORT free-text type label (a word or two, NOT a sentence) describing what role the dep plays — e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends", "supersedes". Required on every dep.
- Setting depends_on provides the dependency's out_dependency_files to your artifact at execution time
- If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use empty depends_on
- New artifact IDs are assigned by the system after submission — do not invent IDs for your proposed artifacts

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

Your previous response had issues that need fixing:

DEPENDENCY ERRORS (depends_on can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts>):
  - Strategy 1: artifact 'experiment_iter1_dir2' depends on 'DATASET_0' which does not exist in artifact pool
  - Strategy 1: artifact 'evaluation_iter1_dir3' depends on 'EXPERIMENT_0' which does not exist in artifact pool
  - Strategy 1: Artifact 'experiment_iter1_dir2': dependency 'DATASET_0' does not exist in artifact pool
  - Strategy 1: Artifact 'evaluation_iter1_dir3': dependency 'EXPERIMENT_0' does not exist in artifact pool

</verification_results>

<task>
Fix ALL issues above and regenerate your strategies:

1. Fix dependency errors:
   - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects — every entry MUST have a non-empty short label
   - id can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts>
   - You CANNOT reference artifacts you are proposing in this strategy as dependencies (they all run in parallel)
   - Follow the dependency type rules (e.g., experiments require datasets)
   - If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use depends_on: []

Output the corrected JSON with the fixed strategies.
</task>
```
