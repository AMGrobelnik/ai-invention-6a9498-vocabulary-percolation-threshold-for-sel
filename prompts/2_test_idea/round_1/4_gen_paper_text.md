<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A research paper writer (Step 3.4: GEN_PAPER_TEXT in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, all artifacts, the previous paper draft (if any), and reviewer feedback.
Write a complete paper draft with figure placeholders.

Publication-quality paper → strong contribution. Weak paper → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher drafting a paper, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points.

- Structure as a paper would: research question → methodology → results → analysis → limitations. Not a list of "we did X, then Y."
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. Don't spin failures as "future work."
- The paper's headline contribution should be a positive or surprising finding. Negative results are valuable context but should not be the primary narrative — lead with what works.
- Address reviewer feedback from previous iterations explicitly — show you've thought about each critique.
</research_methodology>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

title: >-
  Vocabulary Percolation Threshold as a Self-Calibrating Summary Length in Word-Frequency Extractive Summarization
hypothesis: >-
  In word-frequency extractive summarization, the optimal number of sentences to include in a summary is not a fixed compression
  ratio (e.g., 20–30%) but emerges from a phase transition in the document's vocabulary co-occurrence network. Specifically:
  building a weighted word co-occurrence graph over the document's content words and greedily adding sentences (ranked by
  aggregate TF word score) until the induced subgraph's giant connected component reaches a critical fraction of the full
  document's giant component size yields summaries that are more coherent and cover key concepts more completely than summaries
  produced at an arbitrary fixed compression ratio. We hypothesize that this percolation-threshold stopping criterion will
  achieve higher ROUGE-1/2/L scores than fixed-length baselines (10%, 20%, 30% compression) on standard benchmark corpora,
  and that the threshold-determined length will vary significantly across document types in a way that is predictable from
  structural properties of the vocabulary network (average degree, clustering coefficient).
motivation: >-
  Every existing word-frequency extractive summarizer—TextRank, LexRank, TF-IDF sentence scoring, and their descendants—requires
  the user or system to specify summary length as a fixed compression ratio (typically 20–30% of source words or a fixed k
  sentences). This parameter is chosen arbitrarily or tuned on validation data, ignoring the structural properties of the
  individual document. A news article covering a single event needs a much shorter summary than a multi-topic review paper
  of the same length. If the compression ratio is wrong, the summary either loses critical concepts (too short) or becomes
  redundant and verbose (too long). By importing the percolation phase transition from statistical physics, we can make the
  stopping criterion data-driven and document-specific: the summary grows until key vocabulary becomes mutually reachable
  in a co-occurrence network, signaling complete conceptual coverage rather than mere word-count thresholds. This directly
  addresses a decades-old, widely acknowledged limitation of extractive summarization, requires no additional training data
  or LLMs, and introduces a principled mathematical criterion (giant component emergence) where only empirical heuristics
  previously existed.
assumptions:
- >-
  The high-frequency content words of a document form a co-occurrence network that undergoes a giant connected component transition
  as sentences are added—i.e., the network is sparse enough that early sentences cover only disconnected vocabulary clusters,
  but a critical set of sentences bridges them.
- >-
  Sentences that contribute 'bridging' edges in the vocabulary network (connecting previously disconnected word clusters)
  carry more conceptual coverage than sentences that add isolated high-scoring words.
- >-
  The percolation threshold (fraction of sentences needed to achieve giant component) varies meaningfully across document
  types and genres, making a fixed compression ratio suboptimal.
- >-
  ROUGE recall against human reference summaries is a valid proxy for conceptual coverage, so percolation-determined summaries
  should score at least as well as fixed-ratio summaries on ROUGE metrics.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. DATA: Use CNN/DailyMail and/or DUC 2002 single-document summarization benchmarks (freely available via HuggingFace).
  2. VOCABULARY GRAPH CONSTRUCTION: For each document, tokenize and remove stopwords; build a weighted undirected graph where
  nodes are unique content words and edges connect word pairs co-occurring within the same sentence, with edge weight = co-occurrence
  count. 3. PERCOLATION STOPPING CRITERION: Order sentences by descending sum of their constituent word TF scores. Greedily
  add sentences one at a time; after each addition, compute the giant connected component (GCC) size in the induced vocabulary
  subgraph. Record the sentence count k* at which GCC_summary / GCC_document ≥ θ (e.g., θ = 0.8). This k* is the percolation-determined
  summary length. 4. BASELINES: Fixed-ratio summaries at 10%, 20%, 30% of sentences using the same TF word scoring for sentence
  ranking. 5. EVALUATION: Compare ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L of percolation summaries vs. all fixed-ratio baselines. 6. ANALYSIS:
  Measure how percolation-determined k* correlates with document structural properties (degree distribution, clustering coefficient)
  to characterize when percolation length diverges most from fixed ratios.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) percolation summaries achieve statistically significantly higher ROUGE-1 recall than the best fixed-ratio
  baseline on at least one benchmark corpus, or (b) percolation-determined compression ratios vary substantially across document
  types (standard deviation > 10 percentage points) in a way that correlates with document coherence metrics, demonstrating
  that a single fixed ratio is suboptimal. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) percolation-determined lengths cluster tightly around a single
  compression ratio regardless of document type (suggesting the network phase transition adds no new information), or (b)
  fixed-ratio summaries at 20% consistently dominate on both ROUGE precision and recall, indicating the structural stopping
  criterion does not align with human reference summaries.
related_works:
- >-
  TextRank (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004): builds a sentence-level graph where edges encode sentence similarity, ranks sentences
  via PageRank, then selects the top-k sentences. Differs from the proposed hypothesis in two ways: (1) it operates on sentence-level
  nodes rather than word-level co-occurrence; (2) it still requires a fixed k, the stopping criterion the percolation threshold
  is designed to replace.
- >-
  LexRank (Erkan & Radev, 2004): computes eigenvector centrality over a sentence cosine-similarity graph to rank sentences,
  selecting top-k. Same limitation as TextRank—compression ratio is externally specified; no mechanism to determine k from
  the document's own structure.
- >-
  Content Coverage Maximization on Word Networks (Ryang & Abekawa, 2013): uses an influence propagation model (epidemic spreading)
  on a word network to maximize the number of words 'covered' by selected sentences. Related in using word-level networks,
  but maximizes a coverage count under a budget constraint rather than using a phase transition to determine when coverage
  is complete—the budget (number of sentences) is still manually specified.
- >-
  Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli & Card, 1999): applies optimal foraging biology to model how HUMANS navigate information
  patches on the web, predicting when a reader switches from one source to another. This is a descriptive behavioral model
  of human reading, not an algorithmic sentence selection mechanism for automated summarization.
inspiration: >-
  The core idea is a Level 3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer from statistical physics to NLP. In percolation theory
  (Erdős-Rényi random graphs, bond percolation), a network undergoes a sharp phase transition when edge density crosses a
  critical threshold: below it, the network consists of many small disconnected components; above it, a giant connected component
  suddenly emerges spanning most nodes. This transition is a natural 'completeness signal'—it marks the point at which local
  clusters merge into a globally connected structure. Transposed to text: the vocabulary co-occurrence network of a summary
  starts fragmented (early sentences cover isolated topic clusters) and becomes globally connected as conceptually bridging
  sentences are added. The percolation threshold—the point at which a giant vocabulary cluster forms—signals that the summary
  has achieved 'conceptual percolation': all major topic clusters are connected and the summary is complete. This imports
  a mathematically precise stopping criterion into a domain where only empirical heuristics (20–30% compression) previously
  existed. The analogy is structurally tight: words are nodes, co-occurrences are edges, sentences add bundles of edges, and
  summary completeness = giant component emergence.
terms:
- term: Percolation threshold
  definition: >-
    In graph theory and statistical physics, the critical edge density at which a random graph transitions from many small
    disconnected components to having a single giant connected component spanning most nodes. Here it refers to the point
    during sentence addition where the summary's vocabulary co-occurrence subgraph forms a giant connected component.
- term: Giant connected component (GCC)
  definition: >-
    The largest connected subgraph in a network, measured by number of nodes. In the summary vocabulary graph, it represents
    the set of content words that are mutually reachable via co-occurrence links—i.e., the core conceptual cluster of the
    summary.
- term: Word co-occurrence graph
  definition: >-
    An undirected weighted graph where nodes are unique content words (after stopword removal) and edges connect any two words
    that appear together within the same sentence, with edge weight equal to the number of sentences containing both words.
- term: Percolation-determined summary length (k*)
  definition: >-
    The number of sentences at which the GCC of the summary's vocabulary subgraph first exceeds a threshold fraction θ of
    the GCC of the full document's vocabulary graph. This is the proposed data-driven replacement for a fixed compression
    ratio.
- term: TF word score
  definition: >-
    Term Frequency score: the raw count of a content word within the document, used here to rank sentences by their aggregate
    importance (sum of TF scores of constituent content words).
- term: Compression ratio
  definition: >-
    The fraction of original sentences (or words) retained in the summary. Existing extractive methods treat this as a fixed
    input parameter (typically 10–30%); the proposed hypothesis determines it automatically via percolation.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that the optimal summary length in word-frequency extractive summarization is determined by a percolation
  phase transition in the document's vocabulary co-occurrence network: sentences should be added (in TF-score order) until
  the summary's induced vocabulary subgraph forms a giant connected component, signaling complete conceptual coverage. This
  replaces the universally used but poorly motivated fixed compression ratio with a document-specific, mathematically grounded
  stopping criterion imported from statistical physics.

  CNN/DailyMail 3.0.0 — 2000 News Article/Summary Pairs for Extractive Summarization
summary: |-
  Dataset: CNN/DailyMail 3.0.0 (abisee/cnn_dailymail on HuggingFace, 260k downloads, well-established NLP benchmark).

  Content: 2000 test-split examples from the CNN/DailyMail dataset. Each example has:
  - input: full news article text (mean 575 words, range 73–1846 words)
  - output: multi-sentence bullet-point highlights (mean 42 words, typically 2–5 sentences separated by newlines)
  - metadata_id: e.g. 'cnndm_test_0000'
  - metadata_task_type: 'summarization'
  - metadata_source_id: original SHA1 article id

  Why CNN/DailyMail over XSum: CNN/DM highlights are multi-sentence extractive-style summaries (mean 42 words) that map naturally to extractive evaluation; XSum summaries are single-sentence abstractive (mean 21 words) less suitable for word-frequency extractive methods. CNN/DM articles are also longer (575 vs 384 mean words), providing more signal for frequency-based sentence scoring.

  Percolation-Threshold Extractive Summarizer vs Fixed-Ratio Baselines on CNN/DailyMail
summary: >-
  Implemented and evaluated a percolation-threshold extractive summarizer against fixed-ratio baselines on 2000 CNN/DailyMail
  test documents. The percolation method builds a vocabulary co-occurrence graph from the document, then greedily adds TF-scored
  sentences until the giant connected component (GCC) of accumulated words reaches a critical fraction theta of the full document's
  GCC. Four theta values (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) and three fixed-ratio baselines (10%, 20%, 30%) were evaluated on ROUGE-1/2/L
  F1. Key results (n=2000): Fixed-ratio baselines dominate on ROUGE — fixed_0.10 achieves mean ROUGE-1 F1=0.286, while best
  percolation (theta=0.6) achieves 0.201. Percolation compression ratios show substantial variance (theta=0.8: mean=0.629±0.092,
  range ~0.2-1.0), confirming the method adapts dynamically to document structure rather than using a fixed budget. Statistical
  tests confirm fixed baselines significantly outperform percolation (p<0.001). Correlation analysis between compression ratio
  and network properties (avg_degree, clustering coefficient) reveals how document graph topology influences percolation stopping
  behavior. The honest negative finding — that graph-theoretic stopping does not improve ROUGE over simple TF-ratio selection
  — is itself a meaningful scientific result about the disconnect between lexical coverage metrics and extractive quality
  metrics. All per-document results, aggregate statistics, statistical tests, and network property correlations are stored
  in method_out_raw.json and the schema-validated method_out.json.

summary: >-
  Evaluated percolation-threshold extractive summarization (4 thetas: 0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9) against fixed-ratio TF baselines (10%/20%/30%)
  on 2000 CNN/DailyMail test documents. Key findings: (1) ROUGE-1 recall improvement of +0.152 for percolation@0.9 vs fixed@30%
  (Wilcoxon Holm-corrected significant, p<0.05 for all rouge1_r comparisons at theta=0.9); (2) compression ratio std=0.077
  does NOT exceed the 10pp threshold — hypothesis partially supported; (3) network feature regression R²=0.10, confirming
  weak but non-zero predictability of compression from structural features (avg_degree and clustering_coefficient are top
  correlates); (4) segment analysis split by article length (short=CNN-proxy, long=DailyMail-proxy) shows consistent percolation
  advantage in both segments. The verdict is hypothesis_supported=False due to std<0.10, but ROUGE-1 recall improvement is
  significant and large. Percolation@0.9 is the best theta. Outputs include eval_out.json (validated against exp_eval_sol_out

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right.

Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

description: Academic paper writing guidance for AI research. Covers paper structure, figure placeholders, bibliography building with Semantic Scholar, and citation rules. Does NOT cover LaTeX compilation or figure file generation — see aii-paper-to-latex for that.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

---

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
